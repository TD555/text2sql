Text-to-SQL Conversion using BART Model
Overview
This project aims to convert natural language queries into SQL queries using the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model. By leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, the model interprets user queries and generates corresponding SQL queries, facilitating efficient interaction with databases.

Features
Text-to-SQL Conversion: Translate natural language queries into SQL queries.
Accuracy Evaluation: Assess the accuracy of generated SQL queries against ground truth queries.
SQL Query Execution: Execute generated SQL queries against a database to validate their correctness.
BART Model Integration: Utilize the BART model, fine-tuned on a text-to-SQL dataset, for efficient query translation.
Requirements
Python 3.x
PyTorch
Transformers library (Hugging Face)
SQL database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) for query execution
Installation
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/TD555/text2sql.git
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download pre-trained BART model weights or train the model on your dataset.
Usage
Prepare your dataset consisting of natural language queries and corresponding SQL queries.
Train the BART model on your dataset or utilize pre-trained weights.
Fine-tune the model for text-to-SQL conversion task.
Evaluate the model's accuracy on a test dataset using evaluation metrics such as exact match accuracy and SQL query accuracy.
Integrate the model into your application for real-time text-to-SQL conversion.
Example

from transformers import BartForConditionalGeneration, BartTokenizer
import torch

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model = BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("text2sql_model_L2")
tokenizer = BartTokenizer.from_pretrained("text2sql_model_L2")

# Example query
query = "What is the average salary of employees in department 101?"

# Tokenize query
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(query, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate SQL query
output_ids = model.generate(input_ids)

# Decode generated SQL query
sql_query = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print("Generated SQL Query:", sql_query)
