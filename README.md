Text-to-SQL Conversion using BART Model
Overview
This project aims to convert natural language queries into SQL queries using the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model. By leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, the model interprets user queries and generates corresponding SQL queries, facilitating efficient interaction with databases.

Features
Text-to-SQL Conversion: Translate natural language queries into SQL queries.
Accuracy Evaluation: Assess the accuracy of generated SQL queries against ground truth queries.
SQL Query Execution: Execute generated SQL queries against a database to validate their correctness.
BART Model Integration: Utilize the BART model, fine-tuned on a text-to-SQL dataset, for efficient query translation.
Requirements

PyTorch
Transformers library (Hugging Face)

Installation
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/TD555/text2sql.git
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Prepare your dataset consisting of natural language queries and corresponding SQL queries.
Train the BART model on your dataset or utilize pre-trained weights.
Fine-tune the model for text-to-SQL conversion task.
Evaluate the model's accuracy on a test dataset using evaluation metrics such as exact match accuracy and SQL query accuracy.
Integrate the model into your application for real-time text-to-SQL conversion.
Example (You can run run.py file.)

from transformers import BartForConditionalGeneration, BartTokenizer
import torch

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model = BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("text2sql_model_L2")
tokenizer = BartTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/bart-base")

# Example query
query = "What is the average salary of employees in department 101?"

# Tokenize query
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(query, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate SQL query
output_ids = model.generate(input_ids)

# Decode generated SQL query
sql_query = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print("Generated SQL Query:", sql_query)
